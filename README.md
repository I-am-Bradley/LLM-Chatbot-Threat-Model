_________________________________________________________________________________________________

## 🧭 Project Overview
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Title: LLM Chatbot Threat Model
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Purpose:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
This repository provides a structured threat model for a chatbot system powered by large language models (LLMs). It identifies high- and medium-risk vulnerabilities across the system’s architecture and prescribes actionable mitigations. The goal is to support secure development, inform executive decision-making, and guide future governance.
## Audience:
- Security Engineers
- Application Developers
- Risk & Compliance Officers
- Executive Leadership (CISO, CTO, CFO)

## 🧱 System Scope and Architecture
## System Components:
- User-facing chatbot interface
- Application logic layer (prompt assembly, agent logic)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
- LLM inference engine
- Agent tools and downstream system integrations
## Trust Zones:
- Untrusted Zone (user input/output)
- Application Zone
- Data Zone (secure)
- LLM Processing Zone (secure)
- Internal System Zone
## Modeling Techniques:
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
- DREAD and CVSS scoring
- Zone-based threat mapping
- Mitigation logic embedded per threat

## 🔐 Threat Analysis Summary
Each file in **THREAT_ANALYSIS/** contains:
- Exploitation points mapped to DFD nodes
- DREAD/CVSS scoring
- Mitigation logic (code-level and architectural)
- Assigned implementation team (Dev, Ops, Sec)

| Threat ID   | Name                     | Risk Level   | Key Mitigations                                      | 
| ----------- | :----------------------: | :----------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | 
| LLM01       | Prompt Injection         | High         | Context Segregation, Input Sanitization              | 
| LLM08       | Excessive Agency         | High         | PoLP, Argument Validation, Human-in-the-Loop         | 
| LLM02       | Improper Output Handling | High         | Context-Aware Encoding, Output Sanitization          | 
| LLM04–LLM10 | Medium Risk Cluster      | Medium       | Resource Quotas, Prompt Redaction, Sandbox Isolation |

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
## Security Teams
→ Start with **THREAT_ANALYSIS/** to understand vulnerabilities and implement controls.
## Developers
→ Use mitigation logic to apply secure-by-design principles in code and architecture.
## Executives
→ Review **FINAL_REPORTS/** for strategic insights and resource planning.
## Compliance Officers
→ Align threat findings with regulatory frameworks and governance policies.

## 📈 Next Steps
- ✅ Implement mitigation roadmap
- 🧪 Conduct adversarial testing
- 📜 Draft AI Governance Policy
- 🔁 Schedule quarterly threat model reviews
